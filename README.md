# PC Tweaker Uninstaller

Uninstall Windows programs cleanly — with a safety net. Part of the
PC Tweaker ecosystem: one account, shared entitlements, loyalty pricing for
existing subscribers.

**Status: pre-release scaffold.** The baseline (strict type checking,
linting, tests, CI gates) is in place; uninstall features land phase by
phase on top of it.

## Architecture

- **Desktop app**: Tauri 2 (Rust core) + React 19 + TypeScript (strict).
- **Backend**: the shared PC Tweaker ecosystem backend (accounts, signed
  licenses, Stripe). This repo contains no server code and no secrets.
- **License model**: the backend signs `{userId, isPro, plan, product,
  issuedAt}` with an Ed25519 key; this client verifies the exact signed
  bytes with the embedded public key and additionally requires
  `product == "uninstaller"` — a valid PC Tweaker license does not unlock
  this app (see `src-tauri/src/license.rs`).
- **Safety model**: every reversible change is snapshotted before it is
  applied (`src-tauri/src/rollback.rs`, atomic writes + locking, ported
  with its tests from PC Tweaker). Privileged actions run one at a time
  through an explicit UAC consent (`src-tauri/src/elevation.rs`).

## Development

```
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

Checks (all of these gate CI):

```
npm run build         # tsc --noEmit + vite build
npm run lint          # eslint (strict, type-checked)
npm run format:check  # prettier
cd src-tauri && cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test
```

## Security notes

- No secrets in this repo; the signing private key exists only on the
  backend host. The embedded key here is the public (verify-only) half.
- Release builds never enable DevTools (see `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`).
- CSP allows network access exclusively to the ecosystem backend.
